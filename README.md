# Multi-AutoSave
initial code by Sambler -> auto_blend_save

Working exactly like the Blender Auto Save but saving incremented files, without deleting older ones.
sometime you need to do a refresh to see last file when you recover it from File Menu > Recover > Auto Save
the path can be changed from blender properties or in the addon prefs
